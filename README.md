MotionManagerDemo
=================

Sample code to show how an iOS Motion Manager component can be used to control the movement of a sprite. 

This sample code contains two versions of the MotionManager component. One is written in Objective-C (MotionManagerSingleton.h and MotionManagerSingleton.m) and one is written in SWIFT (MotionManagerSingletonSwift.Swift). The component is embedded in a sample project. Just start it, tap on the screen and tilt the device (it's not working in the simulator).

The MyScene file
contains code which demonstrates how to use it.
