MotionManagerDemo
=================

Sample code to show how an iOS Motion Manager component can be used to control the movement of a sprite. 

This sample code contains two versions of the MotionManager component. One is written in Objective-C (MotionManagerSingleton.h and MotionManagerSingleton.m) and one is written in SWIFT (MotionManagerSingletonSwift.Swift). The component is embedded in a sample project. Just start it, tap on the screen and tilt the device (it's not working in the simulator).

The MyScene file
contains code which demonstrates how to use it.

Prerequisite is XCode 6.3
